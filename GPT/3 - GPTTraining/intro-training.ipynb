    "## 🧩 Introduction: Converting Text to Tokens (and Back) for GPT Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training or experimenting with a GPT‑style language model, it’s essential to understand how text is represented internally.  \n",
    "Transformer models like **GPT‑2** do not operate directly on raw text—they work with **token IDs**, numerical representations produced by a tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first section introduces a minimal and practical workflow for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoding text into token IDs**  \n",
    "2. **Passing token IDs through a GPT model**  \n",
    "3. **Decoding generated token IDs back into readable text**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `tiktoken` library (the same tokenizer family used by OpenAI models) together with a lightweight GPT‑2 implementation. This lets us test the full round‑trip:  \n",
    "**text → tokens → model → tokens → text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook defines two small utility functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`text_to_token_ids(text, tokenizer)`**  \n",
    "  Converts text into a PyTorch tensor of token IDs and adds a batch dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`token_ids_to_text(token_ids, tokenizer)`**  \n",
    "  Converts model‑generated token IDs back into a human‑readable string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model and Tokenizer Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We instantiate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A GPT‑2 tokenizer (`gpt2` vocabulary)\n",
    "- A compact GPT‑2‑style model using the configuration `GPT_CONFIG_124M`\n",
    "- A simple greedy generation function `generate_text_simple`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Minimal Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we feed an input prompt through the encoder → model → decoder pipeline and print the generated continuation.  \n",
    "This establishes a clear, minimal foundation for understanding **how data flows through a GPT model**, which is crucial before implementing training loops, loss calculation, and optimization.\n",
