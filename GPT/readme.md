## 👋 Welcome

Thanks for stopping by!  
Lately I've been diving deep into the exercises from *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*, and the experience has been eye‑opening. Taking the time to experiment has helped me truly understand how modern LLMs work under the hood — not as magic, but as systems you can build, inspect, and reason about.

If you’re curious about AI, I hope what you find here inspires you to explore, tinker, and learn by doing. Enjoy the space!
