Designed for repeatable, auditable, scalable proofs of value.  <!-- CV -->

**Scope & Outcomes**  
- **Objective:** End‑to‑end orchestration for multi‑store ops, targeted deployments, shrinkage/fraud monitoring, and NLQ to operational data.  
- **Business value:** Faster proof cycles, less setup friction, API guardrails, day‑one observability.  
- **Coverage:** Tenant provisioning; edge‑cluster bootstrap; workload deploy; LLM‑assisted function calls / Vision AI; domain queries; app/transaction monitoring.  <!-- CV -->

**Architecture Highlights**  
1) **Automated tenant provisioning** via CI/CD & APIs  
2) **PXE‑based Edge Kubernetes** install on in‑store endpoints  
3) **API‑driven workload targeting** (servers & touchpoints: POS, kiosks, back office)  
4) **LoRA fine‑tuning of Mistral‑Instruct‑v3** for robust function calling on curated APIs  
5) **LLM interaction** for function calls and domain queries
