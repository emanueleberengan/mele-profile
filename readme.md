# mele‑profile

This space is where I develop my skills, experiment with new technologies, and keep my knowledge up to date.  
You’ll find learning notebooks, hands‑on LLM/GPT experiments, and a short profile.

## What’s in `/GPT`

A practical sandbox for Large Language Models, focused on **training from scratch** and understanding learning dynamics on small corpora.

**Table of contents (TOC):**
- **`intro-training.ipynb`** — first principles:
  - loading text & GPT‑2 tokenization  
  - 90/10 train–test split  
  - dataloaders for next‑token prediction  
  - cross‑entropy loss  
  - a minimal training loop
- **`training.ipynb`** — deeper dive:
  - AdamW loop with periodic evaluation  
  - tracking training vs test loss  
  - controlled **overfitting** on a tiny dataset  
  - text generation samples  
  - loss curve visualization

  <summary>Why no repository tree here?</summary>

Large code blocks with ASCII trees can overflow and hurt readability on small screens.  
This README keeps sections short and links directly to folders instead.
